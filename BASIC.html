            </div><hr><h3>2.Why are you shifting from non IT to IT?</h3><h5>A. Dont say "because salary's are high."  The Interviewer wants to know why you are seeking a job in IT instead of the branch you graduated from. Therefore when you answer this question make sure to clarify the reason for the switch..here some sample answers:</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">

                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>3.What is your salary expectation?</h3><h5>A. Before answering, gather information about the average salary range for similar positions in your industry, location, and level of experience. Websites like Glassdoor, PayScale, or industry-specific salary surveys can provide valuable insights. Assess your skills, experience, and qualifications. If you possess unique expertise or have exceptional qualifications that make you stand out, you may consider aiming for a higher salary.Here some examples...</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5><ul><li><h5>Sample1: Sir,iam fresher to this industry and it's your time to expect from me to be a great part of this company. Iam positive that you pay your employees well.so,can offer me what you think is appropriate for a fresher for this position.</h5></li><li><h5>Sample2:I'm looking for a competitive salary that reflects my qualifications and experience. Based on my research and the requirements of the role as I understand them, I would expect a salary in the range of $X to $Y.</h5> </li><li><h5>Sample3:Given my experience and expertise in [name specifics relevant to the job description], I’m looking to make between $X and $Y in my next role. I’ve done some research on similar roles and talked to people in comparable organizations — all of which helped me confirm that range. I know I’d be a valuable asset to your team and am open to learning more about your budget for the role and the other benefits that you offer employees.</h5></li></ul></h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>4. What are your greatest strengths?</h3><h5>A.Here’s an opening to talk about something that makes you great—and a great fit for this role. When you’re answering this question, think quality, not quantity. In other words, don’t rattle off a list of adjectives. Instead, pick one or a few (depending on the question) specific qualities that are relevant to this position and illustrate them with examples. Stories are always more memorable than generalizations. And if there’s something you were hoping to mention because it makes you a great candidate, but you haven’t had a chance yet, this would be the perfect time.</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5>Sample: <br>I think some of my greatest strengths are my communication skills and willingness to take initiative. During my last internship, when I was helping to manage several social media accounts, I made sure that everyone on the team was on the same page and knew what our messaging strategy was by taking the initiative to send out a weekly email to keep the team up to date and to seek feedback. This ended up being so helpful that the weekly social media update was incorporated into a full-time staff member’s responsibilities.”</h5></p>
                </div>
            </div></p><hr><h3>5.How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?</h3><h5>A.The employer wants to know: Do you hold down the fort or crumble under pressure? They want to make sure that you won’t have a meltdown when the pressure becomes intense and deadlines are looming. The ability to stay calm under pressure is a highly prized talent. here an example..</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5>“I realize stressful situation are always going to come up, and I definitely have had to learn how to navigate them throughout my career. I think I get better at it with every new experience. While working on a new product launch at my last company, for example, things were not going according to plan with my team. Instead of pointing fingers, my first reaction was to take a step back and figure out some strategies around how we could we solve the problem at hand. Previously, I may have defaulted to panicking in that situation, so being calm and collected was definitely a step forward and helped me approach the situation with more clarity.”</h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>6. From your resume it seems you took a gap year. Would you like to tell us why that was?</h3><h5>A.Gap years are more popular in some cultures than others. In some professions, gap years may have a negative connotation (the industry moves too fast and you’re not up to date).Let your interviewer know that your gap year wasn’t about procrastinating over your transition from childhood to adulthood, but that it added value to the confident professional you have become. Based on what part of the world you’re in and how common these are, employers are likely looking to hear stories of what you did and how your experiences have benefitted and prepared you for this role.</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5>“During my last year of high school, I didn’t feel ready to choose my educational path, so I took a wilderness course for a few months to sort out my life goals. It may seem a little random, but the time I spent actually helped my develop so many new skills — in the areas of leadership, communication, (etc…). During that time, I realized that I wanted to earn a degree in (state your degree) to align with my passion (say what that is).”</h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>7.What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?</h3><h5>A.This question may come up as a result of the pandemic. Employers want to know how people used their time differently. Know that you don’t have to feel scared about answering this question if you didn’t spend your time brushing up on skills or taking courses. We learn from any experience we have. If you spent time honing your professional skills, you might say the following.</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5><ul><li>Sample1: “The extra time on my plate really allowed me to get introspective around where I want to take my career. I read a lot of journals to keep abreast of the latest ideas in my field, and sharpened my skills by taking some online courses, such as…” (and then be specific).</li><li>Sample2:“Like everyone else, I, too, gained some time last year from not having to travel two hours a day to and from work. I decided to spend my time on things I love. So I got back to learning how to play the guitar and journaling. I feel it brought me closer to myself and has been really great for my mental health and productivity.”</li></ul></h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>8. What type of work environment do you prefer?</h3><h5>A.Be sure to do your homework on the organization and its culture before the interview. Your research will save you here. Your preferred environment should closely align to the company’s workplace culture (and if it doesn’t, it may not be the right fit for you). For example, you may find on the company’s website that they have a flat organizational structure or that they prioritize collaboration and autonomy. Those are key words you can mention in your answer to this question. Here an example..</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5>“That sounds great to me. I like fast-paced work environments because they make me feel like I’m always learning and growing, but I really thrive when I’m collaborating with team members and helping people reach a collective goal as opposed to competing. My last internship was at an organization with a similar culture, and I really enjoyed that balance.”

                    </h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>9. Why should we hire you?</h3><h5>A.While this question may seem like an intimidation tactic, interviewers generally bring this up to offer you another opportunity to explain why you’re the best candidate. Your answer should address the skills and experience you offer and why you’re a good culture fit.Here an example..</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5>“I have a passion for application development that’s grown stronger over the course of my five-year career. The company’s mission aligns with my personal values and from my limited time in the office, I can already tell this is the sort of positive culture in which I would thrive. I want to work for a company that has the potential to reshape the industry and I believe you’re doing just that.”</h5></p>
                </div>
            </div><hr><h3>10. Do you have any questions?</h3><h5>A.This might be one of the most important questions asked during the interview process because it allows you to explore any subject that hasn’t been addressed and shows the interviewer you’re excited about the role. By this point, you’ll likely have already covered most of the basics about the position and the company so take time to ask the interviewer questions about their own experiences with the company and gain tips on how you can succeed if hired.</h5><div class="card">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="holder.js/100x180/" alt="">
                <div class="card-body" style="background-color: silver;">
                    <h4 class="card-title"></h4>
                    <p class="card-text"><h5> “What do you love about working for this company? What would success look like in this role? What are some of the challenges people typically face in this position?”</h5></p>
